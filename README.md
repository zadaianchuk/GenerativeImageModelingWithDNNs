# GenerativeImageModelingWithDNNs
This is my PyTorch implementation of several papers during Generative Image Modeling with DNN

During the course I've implemented: 
 - Class maximization 
 - Class maximization with regularization ['Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization', Yosinksi et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06579.pdf)
 - Inverting image representation [_'Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them', Mahendran and Vedaldi, 2014_](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Mahendran_Understanding_Deep_Image_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)
 - Netural Texture Syntesis [_Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural
Networks, Gatys et al. 2015_](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5633-texture-synthesis-using-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf).  
 - Neural Style Transfer [_A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, Gatys et al. 2015_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf). 
 - Generative Adversarial Nets [_Generative Adversarial Nets, Goodfellow et al. 2014_](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf)
